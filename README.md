In a house price prediction task in machine learning, the goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on various features or characteristics. These features typically include the size of the house (square footage), the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the location, the age of the property, and other relevant factors.

### Steps Involved:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical data on house sales, including both the features and the corresponding prices.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing outliers, and normalizing the data if necessary. Feature engineering might be performed to create new useful features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices). Visualizations like scatter plots, histograms, and correlation matrices are often used.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate machine-learning model. Common choices include Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
5. **Training the Model**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train the model on the training data, allowing it to learn the patterns in the data.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test data using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or R-squared.
7. **Prediction**: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the prices of new houses based on their features.

The task helps in understanding how different factors influence house prices and how machine learning can be applied to make accurate predictions based on historical data.
